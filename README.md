# angular-bootstrap-seed
Seed template which can be used for the front end development of an angular + bootstrap SPA style web application.

# Installation
Once you have downlaoded and extracted the seed template accordingly, run `npm install` in the base directory. All required dependencies will
be downloaded (including bower) and a Grunt task will be run to build the files required to run the project. This may require that Grunt is installed globally (`npm install -g grunt`).

# Workflow
This seed template is designed to give you a kickstart with your development workflow, so once you have successfully been able to run the example project
you can run `grunt watch`. This will pick up any changes you make in the `public/js` directory and also any change you make to `.less` files.

# Run Server
The script to run the application is `bin/www` so you will need `node bin/www` to run the node server.

# Browse App
The application is run on `http://localhost:3000` by default
